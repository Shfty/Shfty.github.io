I'm a polyglot programmer, familiar with various languages - be they interpreted or compiled, scripted or systems, imperative or functional - who started in the domain of video games (a long-term passion) at an early age by way of WYSIWYG creation tools like Multimedia Fusion and Game Maker.
I studied in BSc Games Technology at the University of the West of England, graduated with honours, and have worked on various commercial projects including Auroch Digital's Unreal 4 adaptation of Dark Future, and interactive experiences for industry clients such as Volvo, Babcock International, and Medtronic.
Outside of work, I dedicate my time to various programming projects, the most notable of which is Qodot; a Quake map integration for the Godot game engine which has seen significant uptake, and featured in the breakout indie title Cruelty Squad.
