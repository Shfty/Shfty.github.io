* Use whole-site path metadata to generate sidebar menu
  with <detail> elements for category pages
  * Now have a tree hierarchy of indices and their children
  * Can map identifiers, titles, etc over the tree to generate
    nested menu content
  * Should be able to invert the tree to generate breadcrumb data
  * Need to investigate making the tree first-class,
    using it to compile categories and pages within
    the appropriate context
    * Very likely that there are typeclasses existing functionality
      can be lifted into to streamline and generalize the whole process

* Fixup URLs in parentRoute
  * Currently breaking images, which lack the pages/ prefix

* Generalize compiler / template metadata fields and integrate
  with recursive page compiler

* Metadata-driven context provision
  * Pages should be able to request certain context elements
    (ex. child pages, child posts, date, etc.)
    in order to drive their requested set of templates
  * Will likely need to invent some basic query syntax
    so pages can request a specific subset of the site's posts

* Support arbitrary extensions for pages in recursive hierarchy
  * Currently hardcoded to .md, should be an open set

* Move title element into a proper template
  * Pages should be free to elide it and provide their own
by  * ex. Home page should be able to elide the home glyph and ~
    in favour of "Home" or similar

* Investigate compile-time configuration
  * Useful for development / release profiles that can filter out content
    based on some tag or arbitrary metadata element
  * Does the hakyllWith function provide means to handle command line arguments?
    * If not, can parse a config file similar to the pandoc highlight JSON

* File type metadata
  * Should provide the means to look up a name and glyph
    for purposes of sidebar menu and header readout
    * Filetype should provide a default glyph that can be overridden
      via a separate 'glyph' metadata field

* Clean URLs
  * Should be eliding index.html, stripping extensions,
    possibly performing some filename transform for consistency
  * The Hakyll site should have a tutorial on this

* Support for regular tags
  * Apply recursive categories as regular category tags
  * Extend with arbitrary set of metadata-defined tags
  * Generate free-standing index pages for each regular tag

* Generalize sidebar / navigation panels under a single reusable component
  * Fixed-width header + arbitrary content
  * Should be able to use templating for this
    * Build navigation content and header HTML,
      then substitute into the appropriate template

* Code structure pass
  * Need to structure, generalize, and possibly organize into modules

* Current page highlight for sidebar
  * Should be able to style the link representing the active page

* Intelligent open / close for sidebar
  * Likely won't be able to do global state
    without introducing cookies or HTML5 local storage
  * Ergo, the next-nicest approach is to expand all directories
    above the current file, and leave the rest closed

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Figure out a way to collect header jump links ahead of time
  * Parse into an HTML navigation section,
    display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens
    * Can probably inline into main content on narrow devices

* Formalize navigation panel on narrow screens
  * How to integrate nicely with a vertical layout?
    * Pop-over element?
    * Inline at top of main content?

* Fix background image behaviour with cover scaling
  * Need to query against the aspect ratio of the image,
    adjust scaling behaviour accordingly
  * Is there some more abstract media query to determine pixel density?

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes
