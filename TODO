* Contextual folding + current page highlight for sidebar menu
  * Now the menu is being generated piecemeal by each page
    in the site hierarchy, it should be more viable to drive
    details elements' open attribute based on current URL
    * Final menu is loaded from root index.html menuSection
    * Nicest approach is probably to map over HTML nodes
      during final page rendering, and apply an open attribute
      if their data-url attribute is a substring of the underlying URL
      * Should also strip data-url for cleanliness
      * Prevents needing to render out multiple versions of
        the same thing with minor changes
      * Can use the same logic to apply a HTML ID to 
        the currently-active menu entry for styling

* Formalize Categories / Pages model
  * Currently causing ex. 'Game Jam / Synth Rider' to display the wrong icon
    * Displaying a dropdown is still desirable,
      since images and other colocated assets should have their own
      viewer pages generated
  * Categories (index.html with sibling .html files)
  * Branch Pages (index.html with no sibling .html files)
  * Leaf Pages (non- index.html)

* Page generation for asset files
  * Images, videos, etc.
  * Should remain within the TUI interface,
    but show a full-panel viewer for the respective content
    * Ideally, high-res images should be able to zoom to full size,
      similar to the way a browser displays an image when loaded directly

* Look into refactoring breadcrumb generation 
  * Now the menu is being generated via dependency tree,
    the file tree / ident tree structure is less useful
  * Need to see if breadcrumbs can be generated in a more
    Hakyll-idiomatic way, ultimately allowing the tree to be factored out

* Sort menu links by icon metadata
  * Strictly should be by category, but icon is filling that role as-is

* Full-width category links for menu

* Fix tux icon spacing

* Move breadcrumb into a separate header line
  * Too wide for title position
  * Could integrate with page content as a vertical list on narrow screens?

* Support arbitrary extensions for pages in recursive hierarchy
  * Currently hardcoded to .md, should be an open set

* Use config metadata to setup development / release profiles
  * Can modify the 'master' readout in the header to indicate current mode
    * Or perhaps the 'NORMAL' tag - just something to make it obvious
  * Allow specifying predicates (i.e. via tags) to filter pages out of release mode

* File type metadata
  * Should provide the means to look up a name and glyph
    for purposes of sidebar menu and header readout
    * Filetype should provide a default glyph that can be overridden
      via a separate 'glyph' metadata field
  * File type readout (i.e. icon and type name) should be a version, akin to slug

* Support for regular tags
  * Apply recursive categories as regular category tags
  * Extend with arbitrary set of metadata-defined tags
  * Generate free-standing index pages for each regular tag

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Can use Hakyll's withTags function to map over all tags
    and collect data to drive a sidebar
  * Parse into an HTML navigation section,
    display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens
    * Can probably inline into main content on narrow devices

* Formalize navigation panel on narrow screens
  * How to integrate nicely with a vertical layout?
    * Pop-over element?
    * Inline at top of main content?

* Fix background image behaviour with cover scaling
  * Need to query against the aspect ratio of the image,
    adjust scaling behaviour accordingly
  * Is there some more abstract media query to determine pixel density?

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes
