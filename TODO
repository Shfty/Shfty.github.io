* Finalize tag page structure
  * Tags need metadata for the purpose of specifying icons
    * Ideally should be able to populate site/tags with .md files,
      and connect them up with metadata tags via custom logic
    * Would allow the file route to be used as the tag,
      instead of having to derive it from an arbitrary title
  * Use templates to populate index and tag pages with lists of slugs

* Formalize Categories / Pages model
  * Currently causing ex. 'Game Jam / Synth Rider' to display the wrong icon
    * Displaying a dropdown is still desirable,
      since images and other colocated assets should have their own
      viewer pages generated
  * Categories (index.html with sibling .html files)
  * Branch Pages (index.html with no sibling .html files)
  * Leaf Pages (non- index.html)

* Styling for image / video viewers
  * Should be able to use CSS contain / cover
  * Would also be nice to provide CSS click-to-zoom for high-res images

* Polish sorting algorithm
  * Should be split between categories / pages
    * Then split by icon
      * Then sorted alphabetically
  * Need to separate 'category pages' from categories

* Move breadcrumb into a separate header line
  * Too wide for title position
  * Could integrate with page content as a vertical list on narrow screens?

* Formalize navigation panel on narrow screens
  * How to integrate nicely with a vertical layout?
    * Pop-over element?
    * Inline at top of main content?

* Fix background image behaviour with cover scaling
  * Need to query against the aspect ratio of the image,
    adjust scaling behaviour accordingly
  * Is there some more abstract media query to determine pixel density?

Fixes
------------
* Tag generation for 'category pages'
  * Currently omitted to prevent regular categories from contributing

* Full-width category links for menu

* Fix tux icon spacing

Nice to have
------------
* Derive default page icon from filetype
  * Can test with raw_index.html

* Support arbitrary extensions for pages in recursive hierarchy
  * Currently hardcoded to .md, should be an open (or potentially closed w.r.t. pandoc inputs) set

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Can use Hakyll's withTags function to map over all tags
    and collect data to drive a sidebar
  * Parse into an HTML navigation section,
    display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens
    * Can probably inline into main content on narrow devices

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes

* Refactor gh-pages action to manually package and deploy payload
  * Currently uploading to the gh-pages folder,
    and letting the default 'pages build and deploy' handle it
  * Would be tidier and faster to handle it via explicit jobs

* Item-based embedding for image and video assets
  * Can use metadata to separate image viewer content (subtitle, etc)
    from main page content, inline automatically
