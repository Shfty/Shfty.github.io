* Recursive categories
  * Generate path metadata for all pages under a given path
    * Path metadata is like category metadata,
      but without pruning off the start of the path
  * Special-case index.md files to represent their parent
    directory's category instead of acting as a member of it
  * Use per-page path metadata to generate breadcrumb trails
  * Use per-category path metadata to generate list pages
  * Use whole-site path metadata to generate sidebar menu
    with category pages acting as <detail> elements

* Generalize sidebar / navigation panels under a single reusable component
  * Fixed-width header / footer + arbitrary content

* Integrate hakyll-images to generate resized copies of background images,
  serve conditionally via media queries

* File type metadata
  * Should provide the means to look up a name and icon
    for purposes of sidebar menu and header readout

* Current page highlight for sidebar
  * Should be able to style the link representing the active page

* Intelligent open / close for sidebar
  * Likely won't be able to do global state
    without introducing cookies or HTML5 local storage
  * Ergo, the next-nicest approach is to expand all directories
    above the current category, and leave the rest closed

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens

* Prevent divider from shrinking horizontally on narrow screens

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes
