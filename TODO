* Clean up unused code
  * Breadcrumbs
  * Highlighting
  * Tags

* Clean URLs
  * Now using extensionless URLs, but need to strip index,
    and ensure all URLs are properly transformed
    (ex. currently-broken breadcrumb URLs)
  * https://chungyc.org/article/technical/website/extensionless
  * May need a separate fixup procedure for deployment to GitHub Pages,
    as it doesn't support .htaccess, but does support extensionless URLs

* Sort menu links by icon metadata
  * Strictly should be by category, but icon is filling that role as-is

* Full-width category links for menu

* Fix tux icon spacing

* Move breadcrumb into a separate header line
  * Too wide for title position
  * Could integrate with page content as a vertical list on narrow screens?

* Current page highlight for sidebar
  * Should be able to style the link representing the active page

* Contextual folding for sidebar
  * Likely won't be able to do global state
    without introducing cookies or HTML5 local storage
  * Ergo, the next-nicest approach is to expand all directories
    above the current file, and leave the rest closed

* Support arbitrary extensions for pages in recursive hierarchy
  * Currently hardcoded to .md, should be an open set

* Use config metadata to setup development / release profiles
  * Can modify the 'master' readout in the header to indicate current mode
    * Or perhaps the 'NORMAL' tag - just something to make it obvious
  * Allow specifying predicates (i.e. via tags) to filter pages out of release mode

* File type metadata
  * Should provide the means to look up a name and glyph
    for purposes of sidebar menu and header readout
    * Filetype should provide a default glyph that can be overridden
      via a separate 'glyph' metadata field
  * File type readout (i.e. icon and type name) should be a version, akin to slug

* Support for regular tags
  * Apply recursive categories as regular category tags
  * Extend with arbitrary set of metadata-defined tags
  * Generate free-standing index pages for each regular tag

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Figure out a way to collect header jump links ahead of time
    * Use Blaze to parse generated HTML and pick out <h*> tags?
  * Parse into an HTML navigation section,
    display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens
    * Can probably inline into main content on narrow devices

* Formalize navigation panel on narrow screens
  * How to integrate nicely with a vertical layout?
    * Pop-over element?
    * Inline at top of main content?

* Fix background image behaviour with cover scaling
  * Need to query against the aspect ratio of the image,
    adjust scaling behaviour accordingly
  * Is there some more abstract media query to determine pixel density?

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes
