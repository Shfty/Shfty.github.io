* Generate breadcrumb data from metaTree

* Formalize menu entries and header templating
  * Both of these can be thought of as variants of their source page,
    and can be generated independently of other content
    * Ergo, render them out as versions using a domain-specific compiler,
      so they can be pulled into sidebars, headers, etc. fully formed
    * Should be able to set it up such that pages can specify
      their header template/s via metadata

* Support arbitrary extensions for pages in recursive hierarchy
  * Currently hardcoded to .md, should be an open set

* Move title element into a proper template
  * Pages should be free to elide it and provide their own
    * ex. Home page should be able to elide the home glyph and ~
      in favour of "Home" or similar

* Investigate compile-time configuration
  * Useful for development / release profiles that can filter out content
    based on some tag or arbitrary metadata element
  * Does the hakyllWith function provide means to handle command line arguments?
    * If not, can parse a config file similar to the pandoc highlight JSON

* File type metadata
  * Should provide the means to look up a name and glyph
    for purposes of sidebar menu and header readout
    * Filetype should provide a default glyph that can be overridden
      via a separate 'glyph' metadata field
  * File type readout (i.e. icon and type name) should be a version, akin to slug

* Clean URLs
  * Should be eliding index.html, stripping extensions,
    possibly performing some filename transform for consistency
  * The Hakyll site should have a tutorial on this

* Support for regular tags
  * Apply recursive categories as regular category tags
  * Extend with arbitrary set of metadata-defined tags
  * Generate free-standing index pages for each regular tag

* Generalize sidebar / navigation panels under a single reusable component
  * Fixed-width header + arbitrary content
  * Should be able to use templating for this
    * Build navigation content and header HTML,
      then substitute into the appropriate template

* Current page highlight for sidebar
  * Should be able to style the link representing the active page

* Contextual folding for sidebar
  * Likely won't be able to do global state
    without introducing cookies or HTML5 local storage
  * Ergo, the next-nicest approach is to expand all directories
    above the current file, and leave the rest closed

* Table of Contents support for markdown articles
  * Figure out a way to collect header jump links ahead of time
  * Parse into an HTML navigation section,
    display in a right-side panel on sufficiently wide screens
    * Can probably inline into main content on narrow devices

* Formalize navigation panel on narrow screens
  * How to integrate nicely with a vertical layout?
    * Pop-over element?
    * Inline at top of main content?

* Fix background image behaviour with cover scaling
  * Need to query against the aspect ratio of the image,
    adjust scaling behaviour accordingly
  * Is there some more abstract media query to determine pixel density?

* JavaScript-driven scroll position indicator
  * Update main header to show percentage whenever scroll position changes
